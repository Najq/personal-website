Debugging is fun, and according to me debugging time exponentially increases if the code was written in a sloppy manner. Point being...python default arguments can be tricky to deal with. 

If the code you've written is - 
```python
def append_to(element, to=[]): 
    to.append(element) 
    return to 
```

You might expect this to - 
```python
my_list = append_to(12)
print(my_list)

my_other_list = append_to(42) 
print(my_other_list)
```
give this output -
```python
 [12] [42] 
```

But, what actually happens is -
```python
[12] [12, 42]
```
 
 A new list is only created once during the function definition, and the same reference is used for future calls. So...if you use a mutable default argument, it will have the same reference for all the future function calls. Pretty sucky. That's why follow this code pattern 
```python
def append_to(element, to=None): 
    if to is None: 
        to = []
        to.append(element) 
    return to
```

Buh bye!
